Dependency-free neural network inference framework in a single file

## What is it for
Inference with simple neural networks where installing dependencies is not possible. This project is and will be dependency-free and has the most open open-source-licence. Whatever you need it for, just copy the single .py file into your project and you'll be able to run an already trained neural network. 

## What is it NOT for
Since it is written 100% in python, it is the performace is terrible compared to pytorch or numpy based frameworks. It also does not and will never do support training of neural networks, but is designed to load simple pytorch neural networks.
